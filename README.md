1. Simple Models has pre written answers and predicts diseases in base of symptoms that come as an input.
2. LSTM Model uses the calculations of LSTMs to predict the next word in based of the users input.
3. Transformers T5 and GPT try to use a pre- built models from HuggingFace to fine tune with the data.

The data used is on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/medical-conversation-corpus-100k
